/**
 * @brief An empty implementation of L8Export.
 *
 * The Objective-C runtime might not load the L8Export protocol
 * if it is not used by any protocol or class. Because L8WrapperMap
 * uses the protocol declaration in its code, it crashes when
 * L8Export protocol is never used. This is to make sure the
 * runtime loads the protocol.
